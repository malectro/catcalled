      <h1>Cat<span>called</span></h1>
      <div class="cc-subtitle">is a two-week long writing project by women living in New York on their experiences with being objectified and sexually harassed on city streets. Each daily log was kept by one of our 13 participants over the course of two weeks in August 2012. In the entries the women reflect on vulnerability, power, objectification, and safety in their urban environments.</div>

        <div class="cc-interview">
          <div class="cc-interview-query">How would you describe the street harassment situation in your neighborhood?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Currently, it sucks. I recently moved from Little Italy back into my mother's neighborhood which is located in the South Bronx and the attention I receive from men, while walking to the train or just going to the corner store, is mind-blowing. And not in a good way.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What has been your experience with sexual harassment to date?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I felt I was "late" in experiencing sexual harassment because I have always looked younger than my age, and wore baggy clothes for most of my early teen years due to feeling uncomfortable with my body. Once I did start feeling comfortable and began wearing clothing that was fitted or very "feminine" like tight jeans, skirts and heels, I noticed the amount of attention I received go up dramatically. This isn't to say that I never experienced harassment as a young girl, but compared to my friend's who had developed at an early age and were being harassed as early as 11 by men, I would say I started receiving that sort of negative attention later than most girls.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Can you remember the first time you felt unsafe in your environment due to catcalling?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">There are two very specific instances that come to mind: one that took place in my home, the other which took place near the 161st Street Mall. The one in my home took place during Thanksgiving. I come from a family of party people, so after holiday dinners my family likes to drink and dance. Being 16 at the time, I wasn't allowed to drink, but I was hanging out around adults that did, and was approached by a married-in "uncle" who about 7-9 years older than me. I was wearing a shirt that showed my belly ring and he touched my stomach, eyed me, and said, "You know, you'd better be careful with that." At the time I wasn't fully aware of the impact of his words, but I know they made me feel sick enough to go into my bedroom and cry. To this day, I stay as far away from him as possible when we're at family gatherings and never try to be alone in the same room with him. The other experience happened in the summer time while I was walking from the 161st Street 4 train to the mall. As I was walking, in jeans and a t-shirt, I was approached by an older man who proceeded to tell me how much he enjoyed the gap between my legs because it meant my pussy was "so sweet". He continued to follow me for a few blocks, all the while repeating his disgusting nonsense, until I ran across the street and all the way to the mall. Asshole.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What do you think is specific to the New York experience of street harassment?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I think men in New York, especially NYC proper, feel as if it is their right to touch, and grab, and talk to women and are offended, even shocked, when we lash out in anger or discomfort. I cannot even tell you how many men have grabbed me in order to get my attention, and when I let them know, sometimes quite angrily, that they have no right to touch me, they become upset. They tell me, "Damn, ma, you don't got to be so serious" or, my personal favorite, "relax". I even had one guy tell me to calm down because it wasn't like he was going to rape me. -___-</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Have you ever found catcalling flattering?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Nope. Never.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Is there anything else you think your audience should know about your past experiences?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Lately I've been realizing how harassment takes on different forms depending on whether men on the street view me as a straight woman or a queer (gay) woman. When men view me as straight, they hiss and make passes. They see me as an open target in which to harass and claim as their own. However, when men view me as gay, they look at me and my partner in disgust. They are offended that I don't want them. They see me, and my sexuality, as a threat. It's actually really amusing to know that my sexuality, which has absolutely nothing to do with them, can upset their poor little egos so much.
            <br /><br />
            Lastly, I am really excited to be a part of this project. I think harassment, especially street harassment, happens to women on such a huge scale, yet we are constantly taught to ignore it and it's sickening. I quite often respond to harassment with attitude and have always been told to "not do that because it will provoke them into doing more," and I can't tell you how furious and sad that makes me. It's sad that I'm expected to just stand idly by while men are allowed to say or do whatever they want to me. All of that feeds into rape culture and this idea that "boys will be  boys," and I feel that we, as a whole, are doing future generations of young girls and women a big disservice by not talking about this. Which is why I'm really happy to be a part of catcalled. :)
