      <h1>Cat<span>called</span></h1>
      <div class="cc-subtitle">is a two-week long writing project by women living in New York on their experiences with being objectified and sexually harassed on city streets. Each daily log was kept by one of our 13 participants over the course of two weeks in August 2012. In the entries the women reflect on vulnerability, power, objectification, and safety in their urban environments.</div>

        <div class="cc-interview">
          <div class="cc-interview-query">How would you describe the street harassment situation in your neighborhood?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Currently, it sucks. I recently moved from Little Italy back into my mother's neighborhood which is located in the South Bronx and the attention I receive from men, while walking to the train or just going to the corner store, is mind-blowing. And not in a good way.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What has been your experience with sexual harassment to date?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I felt I was "late" in experiencing sexual harassment because I have always looked younger than my age, and wore baggy clothes for most of my early teen years due to feeling uncomfortable with my body. Once I did start feeling comfortable and began wearing clothing that was fitted or very "feminine" like tight jeans, skirts and heels, I noticed the amount of attention I received go up dramatically. This isn't to say that I never experienced harassment as a young girl, but compared to my friend's who had developed at an early age and were being harassed as early as 11 by men, I would say I started receiving that sort of negative attention later than most girls.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Can you remember the first time you felt unsafe in your environment due to catcalling?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">There are two very specific instances that come to mind: one that took place in my home, the other which took place near the 161st Street Mall. The one in my home took place during Thanksgiving. I come from a family of party people, so after holiday dinners my family likes to drink and dance. Being 16 at the time, I wasn't allowed to drink, but I was hanging out around adults that did, and was approached by a married-in "uncle" who about 7-9 years older than me. I was wearing a shirt that showed my belly ring and he touched my stomach, eyed me, and said, "You know, you'd better be careful with that." At the time I wasn't fully aware of the impact of his words, but I know they made me feel sick enough to go into my bedroom and cry. To this day, I stay as far away from him as possible when we're at family gatherings and never try to be alone in the same room with him. The other experience happened in the summer time while I was walking from the 161st Street 4 train to the mall. As I was walking, in jeans and a t-shirt, I was approached by an older man who proceeded to tell me how much he enjoyed the gap between my legs because it meant my pussy was "so sweet". He continued to follow me for a few blocks, all the while repeating his disgusting nonsense, until I ran across the street and all the way to the mall. Asshole.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What do you think is specific to the New York experience of street harassment?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I think men in New York, especially NYC proper, feel as if it is their right to touch, and grab, and talk to women and are offended, even shocked, when we lash out in anger or discomfort. I cannot even tell you how many men have grabbed me in order to get my attention, and when I let them know, sometimes quite angrily, that they have no right to touch me, they become upset. They tell me, "Damn, ma, you don't got to be so serious" or, my personal favorite, "relax". I even had one guy tell me to calm down because it wasn't like he was going to rape me. -___-</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Have you ever found catcalling flattering?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Nope. Never.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Is there anything else you think your audience should know about your past experiences?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">Lately I've been realizing how harassment takes on different forms depending on whether men on the street view me as a straight woman or a queer (gay) woman. When men view me as straight, they hiss and make passes. They see me as an open target in which to harass and claim as their own. However, when men view me as gay, they look at me and my partner in disgust. They are offended that I don't want them. They see me, and my sexuality, as a threat. It's actually really amusing to know that my sexuality, which has absolutely nothing to do with them, can upset their poor little egos so much.
            <br /><br />
            Lastly, I am really excited to be a part of this project. I think harassment, especially street harassment, happens to women on such a huge scale, yet we are constantly taught to ignore it and it's sickening. I quite often respond to harassment with attitude and have always been told to "not do that because it will provoke them into doing more," and I can't tell you how furious and sad that makes me. It's sad that I'm expected to just stand idly by while men are allowed to say or do whatever they want to me. All of that feeds into rape culture and this idea that "boys will be  boys," and I feel that we, as a whole, are doing future generations of young girls and women a big disservice by not talking about this. Which is why I'm really happy to be a part of catcalled. :)

        <div class="cc-interview">
          <div class="cc-interview-query">How would you describe the street harassment situation in your neighborhood?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">It seems like there is not much, or at least not much that I have seen—but this might be
a factor of my often only being in my neighborhood during night-time hours, when the
streets are more sparsely populated (most of my experience with street harassment has
been during daylight hours, not sure if this is typical or just how things have been for
me…). I personally have never been harassed on the streets near my current apartment.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What has been your experience with sexual harassment to date?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">When I first moved to New York City, in 2002, when I was 20, I felt like I encountered
near-constant street harassment. I lived in Manhattan at the time, and that’s where almost
all of the street harassment I have encountered has occurred (I think due to the fact that
a standard Manhattan street during daytime hours is just so many times more populous
than the streets anywhere I have lived in Brooklyn). I got a lot of very lewd, explicit, awful stuff, and during the summertime, I got it on a near-daily basis—once while I
was walking down the street talking to my 60-year-old mother, even. In the summer of
2005, one day I hit a breaking point, and threw a large fountain soda in the face of a guy
moving rugs onto a truck who sexually harassed me during my lunch break. He seemed
to think it was hilarious.
            <br /><br />
          In the years since, I’ve noticed that I’ve received less sexual harassment on the street,
though I think a lot of this is attributable to the iPod I bought myself for Christmas
2005—I’ve barely wandered down a street without it plugged into my earholes since
then, and I am sure that guys are still muttering gross shit, I’m just not hearing it. I’ve
also worked in the far-west side of the West Village since 2007, where there are just
less people on the streets to come in contact with, and that’s brought lunchtime street
harassment (something I dealt with daily while working in the garment district) to an end.
When I’ve wandered iPod-less recently, I find the comments I do hear these days tend
to be far less aggressive/ hateful/ explicit—mostly “girl, you’re so pretty” kind of stuff
or comments on my very-bright-red dyed hair, which still make me uncomfortable. But
I have found it curious that the really awful stuff (i.e. explicit comments on my breasts,
body, very explicit things the harasser would like to “do” to me) has dropped off as I’ve
grown older and began presenting a much more self-confident, less vulnerable face to the
world.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Can you remember the first time you felt unsafe in your environment due to catcalling?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">This is less catcalling and more targeted sexual harassment/ threatening stuff, but
I remember having some guy pull some of that “you’re so pretty, let me have your
number” stuff on me in a mini-mall in Cambridge, MA, in 2001. He came up to me
while I was leaving a women’s clothing store, and I blew him off. Then, after I blew him
off, I went to use the bathroom, and found him waiting outside the ladies room for me
after I finished, in this very deserted-ish section of the mini-mall (I had been the only
person in the whole bathroom area). I was shopping with my boyfriend at the time, who
was a physically intimidating guy, and I remember feeling so grateful that my strong,
tall boyfriend was there, waiting on the other side of the bathrooms, for me, because if
this guy pulled me into the bathrooms and started raping me, my boyfriend would come
looking for me and he could take this guy, physically. I told him to get away from me,
and ran to my boyfriend, who then confronted the guy out of my earshot.
          </div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">What do you think is specific to the New York experience of street harassment?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I imagine it must be the same in any pedestrian city, only in New York it is 100 times
more frequent, because of the increased density of people here. But I’ve been street
harassed in Boston and in Austin, TX, and I felt like the content of the harassment was
basically the same.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Have you ever found catcalling flattering?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">No, not even when the guy is like “you’re so beautiful” or something supposedly
flattering. When a guy does some “you’re so beautiful” catcalling at me, all that
goes through my mind is “1. Well, at least he didn’t call you a cunt or whatever 2.
Say ‘thanks’ and keep moving at a quick pace so he doesn’t fucking rape you.” I think I
am so unnerved by my assumptions about the psychology of men who catcall—that it’s
about power for them, not someone just expressing a thought about how much they like
your outfit—I kind of find it impossible to be flattered, even by a well-meaning idiot or
what have you.</div>

          <div class="cc-interview-query">Is there anything else you think your audience should know about your past experiences?</div>
          <div class="cc-interview-answer">I feel like over the years of being catcalled, I’ve fallen out of habits I had earlier on,
like confronting the guys and trying to shame them. In the year or two (2004-5) when I
was trying to actively confront guys who harassed me, none of them ever apologized—
they always replied with some bullshit like “can’t you take a compliment?” or calling
me a bitch or, frequently, when they had gotten caught doing something there was no
defense for, just shrugging their shoulders and smirking like they were naughty fucking
schoolboys or something. It was so infuriating that I kind of gave up.
